    <h1 class="title is-size-1">Our Story</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
        <strong>The date was August 19th, 2016</strong> - in the basement of the Moore Music Building in Bowling Green,
        Ohio. The BGSU College of Musical Arts freshman class met for a picnic and welcome meeting. Professor of Saxophone,
        Dr. John Sampen, gathered his seven person class to introduce them to each other. It was there when Tess and Drew
        met for the first time! Tess had heard murmurs of this incoming freshman from Michigan, and many of the things
        she heard were talking about this arrogant young hotshot named Drew. The following week saxophone quartet
        placements were announced and as fate would have it, Tess was playing tenor and Drew was playing bari in the
        BGSU freshman saxophone quartet.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
        The quartet (by this point, known as the Epsilon Quartet), was where their relationship began to blossom
        unknowingly to either party. Their time in Epsilon meant that they saw each other quite a bit and traveled
        across Ohio and across the United States. As freshman, the group was  named the winners of the Douglas Wayland
        Chamber Music Competition and would perform across Ohio and on the radio. They also traveled to greater Cleveland
        to perform at Tess’s old middle school, the school at which she is now the band director of! They would travel
        beyond the confines of Ohio: including to Maine for the Fred L. Hemke Saxophone Institute, Washington D.C. for
        the Navy Band Saxophone Symposium, and this was just in their first two years of knowing each other! Tess’s Mom
        rightfully called out during these years that “that boy has a crush on you” and “Drew is a nice boy.” Drew had
        thought Tess was way out of his league. To paraphrase what he told his friends during these years; “she's perfect,
        she is exactly who I want to be with.” He told this to everyone, so much so that the entire quartet and the entire
        College of Musical Arts knew about Drew’s crush… all except Tess of course… that would be too easy.

    </h2>

    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
        Following the great Epsilon breakup of 2018, Tess and Drew continued to be friends outside of the confines of the
        quartet. Tess and Drew had feelings for each other, but never at the same time. Spring semester sophomore year,
        Drew tutored Tess in Music Theory IV on an almost daily basis. Little to Drew’s knowledge… She did not care about
        Music Theory IV, but had ulterior motives. The obliviousness of Drew is almost comical in hindsight as they went
        to Buffalo Wild Wings following rehearsals with the BGSU High School Academy Band, to Levis Commons to get soft
        pretzels at Bar Louie, and even to Tess’s apartment for home cooked meals. This flirty “will they, won't they”
        ultimately lead to Drew joining Tess’s family Thanksgiving. What you may not know about the Koenigs is that
        hanksgiving is the MOST important holiday of the year. Drew being invited meant something but Tess repeatedly
        assured her family “we’re just friends!!”
    </h2>

    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
    They officially got over their mutual fears of sharing their feelings on December 10th, 2018,  where they began dating
    at Tess’s apartment and had their first date at Chipotle. For anyone that knows Tess, this is VERY on brand for her.
    Right from the get go, Tess and Drew knew they were mutually in it for the longhull. They had known each other for
    years and went on many dates prior to 12/10/18. So, it is not a surprise that two years later they would get engaged.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
        Tess hates surprises… so Drew thought it would be a great idea to SURPRISE her. Tess had planned to visit her
        sister in Virginia over spring break of 2020, which was the beginning of this little thing called COVID, maybe
        you've heard of it. Drew secretly planned to fly down to surprise her and propose on the beach on Kira’s base.
        This plan was made possible with the help of Tess’s entire family. He needed a reason to NOT be in Virginia with
        Tess, so they made up a recording session he had to be at in Bowling Green. Her whole family was in on it and
        covered for Drew any time she asked why he couldn’t go to Virginia with her.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4 has-text-justified is-family-sans-serif">
    The date is March 16th, 2020. Virginia Beach was freezing, cold and raining– it was the perfect picturesque setting
    for any cheesy romcom proposal. Now as this was the beginning of the initial lock down, Drew had to get special permission
    to get onto the military base where she was staying - and a special exemption was made for Drew. He donned his brand new,
    perfectly fitting navy blue suit (which does not fit him anymore due to the COVID 30 that he gained). A sign was waiting
    for her on the entrance to the beach stating “Happily ever after starts here” with an arrow pointing down to a message
    in a bottle popping the question. He hunched behind an electrical box on the beach and waited for the perfect moment.
    Once Tess finally arrived, she read the sign and was awestruck by the scene. She asked what he was doing here and he
    responded with “something I should have done a long time ago.” The rest is history.
